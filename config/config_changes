~Z_CALIBRATION~
##To-Do##
# 1. make sure the nozzle and the omron body (not the switch!!) reach the bolthead (See images on Discord)
# 2. Make a backup of your cfg
# 3. Read Protolofts Readme about the script implementation to install it and understand how it works
# 4. Remove z_offset commands from the start gcode and saved values at the bottom of your config (probe and/or endstop)
# 5. Decrease all homig and probing speeds for the first test so you have time to react!

##z_calibrate settings##
########################

[z_calibration]
nozzle_xy_position: 172,238 #-5 for the 4-armed tested cover (may be different for the US nut)
########################
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the nozzle, clicking on the Z endstop.

switch_xy_position: 161,205 #-5 for the 4 armed tested cover (may be different for the US nut)
########################
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the probe's switch body, clicking on
#   the Z endstop.

bed_xy_position: 117.5,117.5
#   a X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) where the print surface (e.g. the center
#   point) is probed. These coordinates will be adapted by the
#   probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the relative_reference_index
#   of the configured bed_mesh, if configured. It's possible to change the relative
#   reference index at runtime or use the GCode argument BED_POSITION of CALIBRATE_Z.

switch_offset: 0.68 #Omron is 0.5!!!
###################
#   The trigger point offset of the used mag-probe switch.
#   Larger values will position the nozzle closer to the bed.
#   This needs to be find out manually. More on this later
#   in this section..

max_deviation: 1.0   
#   The maximum allowed deviation of the calculated offset.
#   If the offset exceeds this value, it will stop!
#   The default is 1.0 mm.
#samples: default from "probe:samples" section
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values
#   will be averaged. The default is from the probe's configuration.
#samples_tolerance: default from "probe:samples_tolerance" section
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. The default is from the probe's configuration.
#samples_tolerance_retries: default from "probe:samples_tolerance_retries" section
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. The default is from the probe's configuration.
#samples_result: default from "probe:samples_result" section
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is from the probe's configuration.
clearance: 6
#   The distance in mm to move up before moving to the next
#   position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's
#   configuration.
#position_min: default from "stepper_z:position_min" section.
#   Minimum valid distance (in mm) used for probing move. The
#   default is from the Z rail configuration.
speed: 100
#   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.
#lift_speed: default from "probe:lift_speed" section
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples and clearance moves. The default is from the probe's
#   configuration.
#probing_speed: default from "stepper_z:homing_speed" section.
#   The fast probing speed (in mm/s) used, when probing_first_fast
#   is activated. The default is from the Z rail configuration.
#probing_second_speed: default from "stepper_z:second_homing_speed" section.
#   The slower speed (in mm/s) for probing the recorded samples.
#   The default is second_homing_speed of the Z rail configuration.
#probing_retract_dist: default from "stepper_z:homing_retract_dist" section.
#   Distance to retract (in mm) before probing the next sample.
#   The default is homing_retract_dist from the Z rail configuration.
#probing_first_fast: false
#   If true, the first probing is done faster by the probing speed.
#   This is to get faster down and the result is not recorded as a
#   probing sample. The default is false.
start_gcode: NOZZLE_BRUSH
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to
#   attach the probe.
before_switch_gcode: PROBE_OUT #change this if your macros are named differently than from Klack config
##############################
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probing on the
#   mag-probe. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be
#   used to attach the probe after probing on the nozzle and before probing
#   on the mag-probe.
end_gcode: PROBE_IN #change this if your macros are named differently than from Klack config
###################
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to
#   detach the probe afterwards.

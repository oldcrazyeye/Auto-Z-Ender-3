# Auto-Z-Ender-3
Auto z calibration is now possible on Ender 3 series printers(atm only tested on ender 3 pro). This is a mounting system that allows you to use the [Voron 2.4 sexbolt by HartK](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/hartk1213/Voron2.4_SexBolt_ZEndstop) or the clone by Mellow alonside the most awesome [KlackEnder by Kevinakasam](https://github.com/kevinakasam/KlackEnder-Probe). These designs allow mounting the sexbolt without drilling holes in you bed carriage, meanwhile retaining stability. Big thanks to [Protoloft](https://github.com/protoloft/klipper_z_calibration) and his excellent work on this which makes this even possible. (Will update with config and more soon)
